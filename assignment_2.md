## Introduction

Verbal number has been attested in a number of languages across the world, most notably those from North-American and Polynesian language families [@crev06, p. 160; @corbett2000, p. 245]. Thus far, Itonama is the only  South-American language for which verbal number has been attested. Sadly, the language has become extinct not so long ago. Verbal number is also present in Sumerian, an ancient Near Eastern Language spoken more than 4000 years ago in southern Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq) [@jagersma10]. 

## Verbal number
<!-- write some more about what it is! -->
As opposed to nominal number, which relates to entities, verbal number relates to actions or states that are repeated across time and/or space (@crev06, p. 160, @jagersma10, p. 414). This type of plurality is usually expressed by verbal affixes and reduplication. Most often derivational rather than inflectional.

For example, in Dutch the plurality of the action 'to walk' in (@du2) depends mostly on the pronoun _wij_. The form _lopen_ has several other meanings, e.g. non-finite, \textsc{2pl}, and \textsc{3pl}, among others.

(@du1) ik loop

(@du2) wij lopen

In Central Pomo, a language spoken in Northern California [@corbett2000], verbal number is used to mark the relation between verb and number:

(@cp1)  dog hooking-catch-\textsc{pfv}\\
        he tied up the dog  

(@cp2)  dog hooking-catch-\textsc{pl.pfv}\\
        he tied up the dogs

In (@cp2) several tying-up events take place, hence the plural marking on the verb [@corbett2000, p. 244].

### Types of verbal number 
@corbett2000 identifies two types of verbal number: _event number_ and _participant number_. Event number is independent of the number of participants. Rather, it denotes the number of actions that take place. The most important distinction that is made with event number is between single and multiple events. Compare for instance the sentences (@ito1) and (@ito2) in Itonama:

(@ito1) why do you want to eat us, uncle?

(@ito2) he has seen us!

Participant number expresses the plurality of actions or states, like in (@cp2). In Sumerian, this is expressed using alternating verb stems. Compare:

(@sum1) 'it (one lamb) is one that lives at PN, the fattener's place' (Jagersma 2010, p. 316).

(@sum2) 'They (sheep) live at Lugal-ikush's place' (Jagersma 2010, p.316).

Although (@sum1) and (@sum2) seem just like agreement in number, there is a difference. According to @corbett2000, the different forms are more like classificatory verbs, i.e. verbs that are semantically compatible with a restricted set of NPs. E.g. the Sumerian singular verb form '...' refers to a single participant, whereas the plural form '...' requires an object that consists of two participants [@jagersma10, p. ???]. The major distinction made by participant number is between one and two, and three or more participants [@corbett2000, p. 248].

## Verbal number in Sumerian

### verb alternation

Sumerian uses two different ways to express verbal number. Some verbs specify number as part of their lexical meaning ([@tbl:altverbs]). Other verbs use reduplication of the verbal stem.

verb        number      
------      -------
v           sg
v           pl

Table: Sumerian alternating verbs {#tbl:altverbs}

Verbal forms that reflect number are not that rare. In German, for instance, verbs are inflected for number, hence they have different forms for singular and plural. German verb forms, however, are part of a paradigm. E.g. \textsc{1sg} _bin_ and \textsc{1pl} _sein_ both belong to the paradigm of _sein_ ('to be'). The Sumerian verb stems in @tbl:altverbs do not behave like this at all. Rather, they behave just like other verbs, showing the same person affixes. Number is part of their lexical meaning.

Generally, it is assumed that the verbs in @tbl:altverbs show participant number [@jagersma10, p. 317]. However @jagersma10 argues that the crucial factor is not the number of a syntactic function, but rather that of a certain semantic role. It is always the role of the most directly affected participant that is pluralized. However, verbal number is not determined by this. @jagersma10 shows that these singular and plural verb forms primarily express verbal number, but because multiple events imply multiple participants the association with participant number is not far fetched [@jagersma10, pp.317-319]. 

### Verb reduplication

Verb alternation is limited to a small subset of Sumerian verbs. Verbal number, however, is not. For verbs that do not belong to the subset in @tbl:altverbs, Sumerian uses full verb stem reduplication to express number. E.g.:

(@sum3) 'He fashioned several clay nails.' (En. I 30 2:7; L; 25) 

The pluralized stem mainly expresses event number, e.g. plurality of action or state [@jagersma10 p. 319-322].

## Verbal number in Itonama

According to @crev06, number is a purely verbal phenomenon in Itonama. [@tbl:pln] lists the only nouns for which a plural form has been attested.

------  -----------     -------  -----------
woman   _wabï'ka_         women    _ïwabï_
man     _umu_             men      _umu'ke_
girl    _t'iyaya'tya_     girls    _t'iyaya'tye_
------  -----------     ------   -----------

### Participant number


### Event number

Event number in Itonama is expressed in various ways as well. Strategies include using a distributive marker, (partial) reduplication, or use of a pluractional marker.
